# Opening quality Support cases for Intune

*The purpose of this guide is to provide guidance on how to open up great support cases. 
This will minimize case resolution time, reduce back & forth communications and progress you further into the case from the beginning.*

Please use the table of contents to skip around this guide as needed.

Additionally, please remember this is not a troubleshooting guide, but rather a guide on opening up high quality cases.

# Required for all cases

Each case has a few mandatory things from a high level we will cover:
 
1. The problem
2. The scope of the problem
3. Business Impact

We will cover all of these in-depth.

## The problem

What is the problem at hand? Be clear and concise - here are some examples.
* App deployment
* Device Enrollment
* Configuration Policy
* Resource Access (VPN, Wi-Fi)
* Portal behavior / reporting issues

**When did the issue start?**

***

Now that we have the basics out of the way – let’s dive into technical information to include in the case.

* What platform is affected? (iOS, Windows, Android)
* Is this a policy deployment issue? 
 If so – what kind of policy? App Protection Policy? SCEP? VPN?
Please include the exact name of the policy in the case. 
* Is there currently an affected device that we can actively use to troubleshoot? 
If not, it might be worthwhile to wait until we do have one before opening the case.
* What is the User Principal Name (UPN) of the user who is using it? 
* What is the Intune DeviceId? (Navigate to the device in the Intune Portal, and click on “Hardware”)
* What is the device serial number?
* Is this a problem with a device using MAM/APP without enrollment? If so, let us know – what’s the platform? What type of device is it? What application is it?
* How many users are affected? How many devices?
* Does this affect the same user on other devices?
