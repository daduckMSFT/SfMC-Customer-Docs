# App Protection Policies

Regardless of iOS or Android policies, we typically need the same information when App Protection Policies are involved.

1. What platform? This is important - please let us know whether it is Android or iOS.
2. What is the application being protected? The exact name of it is useful, or the bundle/application ID if it is a custom application with the Intune SDK built-in.
3. What is not working? Be elaborate - what is configured? What is happening? 

Always submit screenshots & videos where applicable. There are a lot of nuances with App Protection Policies and simply seeing what you have configured in the portal, plus what is happening on a device, is extremely helpful to Support staff. 

[Gather, review and submit App Protection Policy logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/app-protection-policy-settings-log) and include the Incident ID.
