# Management Portal
Is there a reporting issue in the portal? If you suspect this, <mark>do not open a case â€“ email your SfMC contacts for Intune & consult with them.</mark>

These steps are also useful for troubleshooting most things in the portal - HAR files are a great source of information as to what the service is providing your browser. 

If we do need to open a case for anything in the portal, please include the below (4) details:
1.	Confirmation that this happens on various browsers (which ones), different IT admins/admin accounts and different networks. 
2.	The URL/area of the portal that you are seeing the problem
3.	Screenshots of the problem
4.	A HAR file taken when you navigate to that area in the portal

**We do not need all of the other technical detail above in most cases, only these (4) things.**

To learn how to capture a HAR trace, watch the quick video below.
