# Apple Devices (iOS / iPadOS / macOS)

Apple devices do not require much to begin a sufficient case. 
In addition to [the details found here](index.md#required-for-all-cases), please ensure that we have Company Portal logs and any other relevant components related to ABM/ADE/VPP. 

If the case is around anything in **Apple Business Manager (ABM)**, please ensure you are aware of the two components. 
- Enrollment
    - Automated Device Enrollment ("ADE"), former DEP ("Device Enrollment Program")
- Application Deployment
    - Volume Purchase Program ("VPP")

Regardless of if ABM is used or not, the common things needed for iOS are...

- Enrollment Method (BYOD vs ADE)
    - If ADE - what type of enrollment is being done? [See here for more info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/device-enrollment-program-enroll-ios#create-an-apple-enrollment-profile)
    - Screenshots always help if possible, or a recording of an enrollment attempt if it fails. 
    - [Get started with common troubleshooting guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/mem/intune/troubleshoot-ios-enrollment-errors)
- Company Portal Logs
    - [Turn on verbose](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/user-help/send-logs-to-microsoft-ios) logging and send reproduce the steps
    - Submit the Incident ID in the case
- Console Logs
    - Easiest to gather witha macOS device
    - These are not commonly needed, but can be useful for more elaborate troubleshooting.

macOS assistance will come soon.
